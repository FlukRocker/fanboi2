Examples
========

This directory contains example configuration for the project. You usually want to copy these files to the root directory according to environment.::

    $ cp alembic.ini.sample ../
    $ cp development.ini.sample ../

Alembic configuration by default will read configuration from ``development.ini``. You may need to change this to point to ``production.ini`` in production environment.
